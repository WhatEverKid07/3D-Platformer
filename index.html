        <h1>Western Wibble</h1>
        <p>A solo 3D game project from college.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This was our second solo college project. We were required to create all the assets ourselves, including 3D models using Maya for the first time.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="thick-underline">Art/Visuals:</span> All 3D models were created in Maya, with textures sourced online or created directly in Maya.
                Any 2D assets, such as UI and backgrounds, were designed in Photoshop.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thick-underline">Sound/Music:</span> Similar to my previous 2D endless runner, music was created using BandLab, and sound effects were either made by me or sourced online.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="thick-underline">Code:</span> The assets and concepts came together in a 3D Unity project. As this was my second experience using Unity and C#,
                I had a much smoother workflow and enjoyed programming even more. This project solidified my decision to prioritize programming as my main focus.
